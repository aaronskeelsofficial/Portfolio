  text: "At the time of this project's creation, I was enrolled at Cal Poly Pomona for Aerospace Engineering and classes had all gone online for Covid. Every semester, random kids would make Discord servers for each individual class. They were incompetent at running them, moderating them, upkeeping them, AND there was just insanity trying to organize every class server for every semester. So I decided to make my own server with a twist. My server would be a hub which is fully autonomously administrated. The system would be a direct democracy where users within the server vote on important topics (such as adding/removing classes or kicking/banning malicious actors) and the autonomous backend robot is actually the entity with sovereignty to conduct the actions in the way the people vote. Voting integrity would be upheld by requiring phone verified accounts to join the server (you can make new accounts but they can't relink with the same phone number). When a vote were to be called, ALL participants of the server would be required to participate as a community endeavor (with all votes allowing yes/no/a third option basically stating \\\"this vote doesn't concern me\\\"). This *requirement* would be forced by removing access to all server channels for an individual until a vote participation has taken place, or after a vote's time had elapsed and the vote concluded, after which their access will be restored.",

If one member continuously invites malicious actors, ban the source at the top of the list.</p><br><p class=\\\"blogtextlist\\\">- Server access locked behind phone verified accounts (not actually implemented atm). The purpose of this is when a malicious actor is banned, it simply permabans them on a much deeper level.</p><br><p class=\\\"blogtextlist\\\">- Fully autonomous administration functions. Almost all functionality is locked behind bot interaction or a vote which a bot executes. No actual human has any sovereignty on the server. I don't care to be responsible and I wanted the server to have the capacity to exist long beyond my existence at the school (though I never actually released it ironically).</p><br><p class=\\\"blogtextlist\\\">- Anti-cheating measures. There is a \\\"Test Mode\\\" the server can be voted into during which access to channels is temporarily stripped until the test mode has been voted out of. This is primarily intended for midterms and finals where students who follow honesty policy will vote the server into a state where no access to prior conversations or material is allowed. There is also a vote for \\\"End of Semester Wipe\\\". This is a one time event which is not able to be undone and wipes all class channels. Public, general channels permanently existing on the server maintain their general purpose content, but channels made specifically for classes are wiped.</p><br><p class=\\\"blogtextlist\\\">- The entire project was made through Replit which is an open source, free host. The purpose of this is ANYBODY can go in, fork the code, and make their own customized version of my server changing any aspects they disagree with.</p><br><p class=\\\"blogtextlist\\\">- A full list of features can be seen by reading the text in the example picture at the top of this page, as well as with the \\\"typical server experience\\\" example process I will show below.</p>",
