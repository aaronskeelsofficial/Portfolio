Immediately I thought 'But what about input signals which are more... creative?' Not only that, but also 'What if we did this independently for an x and y axis, and merged them to get a recreated drawing of any input image?' I simply looked the idea up out of curiosity to see if anything has been posted on it, and unfortunately I am not the first human to have this idea. I AM, however, one of very shockingly few who have had the idea, pursued to implement it into software, and posted about it online. I found four other people who have uniquely done this. One is arguably <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k\\" target=\\"_blank\\" style=\\"color: rgb(115,204,168)\\">the largest mathematics YouTube channel in existence (3Blue1Brown)</a>, another is an equally <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4luNgGfms&t=331s\\" target=\\"_blank\\" style=\\"color: rgb(115,204,168)\\">A tier YouTube channel which does coding projects (The Coding Train)</a>, the third is just <a href=\\"https://olgaritme.com/posts/drawing-with-the-fourier-series/index.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\" style=\\"color: rgb(115,204,168)\\">a random person's *amazing* educational blog post (Olgaritme)</a>, and the fourth is a <a href=\\"https://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" style=\\"color: rgb(115,204,168)\\">separate person's equally *amazing* educational blog post (Jezzamon)</a>. There are a few many more posted online, but it is abundantly obvious who just stole the code from The Coding Train and posted it as their own without actually understanding the math or making it from scratch. An important note is I refused to look into how any of these other people performed the feat. I wanted to go in purely with the math I have learned from my random SoME3 YouTube videos, and figure out how to implement it myself as a means to better my knowledge of both Fourier Series and Complex Numbers. So yeah, that is the project. 'Can I draw a picture by reverse engineering the size, rotation, and frequency of spinning circles which will be stacked on one another and just allowed to go wild?'
