I rarely document properly and I have rarely if ever adhered to any standardized coding style guides, design patterns, nor test-driven developmental workflows. Speaking frankly, I'm aware that's unoptimal, though I also know it's a byproduct of never being placed into an environment which dictates any level of necessity for that. I'm confident in my ability to learn and adapt to meet such standards as is likely a necessity in industry.</p><br><p class=\\"blogtextlist\\">- A good showcase of a time I explicitly made code with documentation for others to comprehend is <a href=\\"https://github.com/thetealviper/Spigot_PortalGun\\" target=\\"_blank\\" style=\\"color: rgb(115,204,168)\\">Here</a>. I created a 'Portal' implementation in Minecraft which requires no client side mods and is handled server-sided, taking advantage of the game's built in packets and protocols. I made it to be both highly *aesthetic* and highly *functional* because the concept was very popular at the time, but all others were very clunky looking or terrible in terms of functionality. I implemented actual linear algebra coordinate space transformations to allow maximum freedom in placement and seamless velocity transfers. I don't recall now, but I believe this also used some other modestly complex math (linear algebra)?</p><br><p class=\\"blogtextlist\\">- I am also aware I don't utilize '.gitignore' and many GitHub specific standardizations on my gaming profile repos (at times in my past I have included entire .jar dependencies in the repo oops). My comments on this are similar to those in the first point. I'm aware of the saying 'You play how you practice' but I truly have unwavering confidence if the scope of my work actually placed any pressure to follow those standardizations I'd have no issue adhering. Proof to back the claim is I believe I did a couple steps better in my personal repo account.</p>`,fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},_={id:"",text:"2.
