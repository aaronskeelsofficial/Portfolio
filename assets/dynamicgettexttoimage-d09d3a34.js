Well mine was empty and I decided to change that. I added all the usual 'badges of honor' like a boyscout/programmer hybrid, but realized that I really wanted to produce more personalized content than static font/image buttons. I wanted to display my total Spigot downloads for example. These downloads are a dynamically, constantly changing number though. First I programmed a backend which pulled from the Spigot API to compute my download count (Spigot does not offer this natively). GitHub only allows dynamic embeds of images, not text, so I now needed to turn this download count string into a picture somehow. My plan was to 'find some GET service online which allowed URL params to yield a dynamically generated image'. This felt like a very fundamental and expected service there would be endless options for, however, the only in existence seem to be services which dynamically RESOURCE actual images from google images based off search queries. They do not turn text into image form. I thought this was so absolutely ridiculous that I simply had to make my own TextToImage generator.
