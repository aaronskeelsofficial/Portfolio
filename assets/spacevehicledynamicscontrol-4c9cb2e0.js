Students were instructed to form teams of three. I, along with the other star pupil in our graduating class, teamed up. We were originally going to only be a team of two, but took ultimately on a third who needed a team. The other star pupil and I ended up doing the totality of the work, however. We completed the project and though I don't recall our exact score, our submission would allegedly become the sample final the professor gave to his graders to compare against for the (at minimum) next year and a half. This project was notorious throughout the entire major as being the most difficult of them all, and admittedly it was quite difficult. It took weeks straight of MatLab/Simulink development and countless restarts from the ground up at points of complete brickwalling. Most students could only attempt the first few question fractions before getting landlocked and being unable to move further. My partner and I completed the entire assignment, however, and believe we got 100%.`,fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},A={id:"",text:"2.

I don't talk to any of my peers from that class, nor would I ever direct them to this website if I did. The secrecy is not meant to uphold copyright/proprietary value in the content, as the problem set can be found amongst countless problems online, in textbooks, on chegg, and in misc blog posts. As for the relation with the professor, I believe we are close enough and he trusts my good will/intentions enough to permit this post.

On top of this, we didn't venture further to find out as curves would ultimately detach our final score from our raw score. Given no single other student could make it past question #1 and we finished the entirety of the assignment, and given we became the sample answer key for years to follow, there is negligible doubt that we headed the curve and would have ended up with 100%.

It was designing the Simulink model in an unoptimal pathing. There is something buggy/funky with Simulink (unsurprisingly because MatLab and Simulink are fundamentally flawed softwares in many ways from a programming standpoint) where pathing through their *included* blocks introduces severe stepping into the data. No matter what settings (which should never need be touched) were tinkered with, and no matter how many forums we searched through to finally find someone asking such a niche question, using certain built in blocks introduced stair-stepping. I'm not going to say which blocks elicit this bug as that voids the obfuscation a bit. The only fix was to rewire the entire loop in an absolutely nonsensical and unnecessary way to get proper data outputs. In some instances this stair-stepping was merely visual, but in others it significantly changed the output of further analyses. Overall, the project was a genuinely challenging yet feasible project for someone knowledgeable and dedicated enough to put in the work.
