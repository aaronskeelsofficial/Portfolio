I immediately ran into issues with Unity's 2d physics system. Every wall became made of super glue. Although the floors and roofs behaved properly, hit detection with walls was simply not behaving properly with vanilla physics so I ended up making my own physics system. This leads to the one issue you'll see in the video below. The block kinda jiggles in place as it likely is being teleported up too far upon intersecting the inside of colliders. It's probably not too hard to fix, but I for some reason didn't fix it back in 2019. The functionality I got done was stationary platforms, disappearing platforms, slippery platforms, sticky platforms, grabbable walls, one way walls, dashing with visual effects, coins for dash \\"charges\\" like in Celeste, checkpoints, respawning, and a springboard (why the springboard? No clue). I used basic colors for all of these as this was a simple level blocking stage. Actual graphics were intended to have been put in their place if I continued the project to later stages (I did not, whoops).`,fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},C={id:"",enablepc:"true",srcpc:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KlEsiZcBMC4",enablephone:"true",srcphone:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KlEsiZcBMC4"},E={id:"",text:"3.
