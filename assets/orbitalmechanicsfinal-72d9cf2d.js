We were to develop a round trip mission statement of a rocket traveling from Earth to Ceres and back to Earth. Considerations were made for efficacy of fuel type, dry/wet mass, impulsive/low thrust, and date of departures. The mission was ultimately split into multiple stages. For my contributions to the project, I used a software called FreeFlyer. FreeFlyer is an orbital mechanics IDE. You'll notice in stage 4 that I programmed my own animation/interpolation system into the software. It currently has no animation functionality and is intended to be used with static camera reference frames. It uses a language similar to C, however, so modifying variables with script during mission simulation runtime is possible. Taking advantage of that, I created an animated camera perspective.",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},H={id:"",text:"Stage 1",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true",whitespacephone:"nowrap"},I={id:"",text:"Stage 1 consisted of the rocket's departure from the surface of Earth and exit of Earth's SOI.",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",textalign:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},M={id:"",enablepc:"true",srcpc:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLHFDwd9nnY",enablephone:"true",srcphone:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLHFDwd9nnY"},E={id:"",text:"Stage 2",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true",whitespacephone:"nowrap"},j={id:"",text:"Stage 2 consisted of the rocket's interplanetary Hohmann Transfer between Earth and Ceres.",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",textalign:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},C={id:"",enablepc:"true",srcpc:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UrLQl1MS8Yk",enablephone:"true",srcphone:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UrLQl1MS8Yk"},q={id:"",text:"Stage 3",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true",whitespacephone:"nowrap"},O={id:"",text:"Stage 3 consisted of the rocket's arrival to Ceres' SOI and parking orbit capture.",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",textalign:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},Y={id:"",enablepc:"true",srcpc:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-cZTqXqFTQ",enablephone:"true",srcphone:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-cZTqXqFTQ"},N={id:"",text:"Stage 4",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true",whitespacephone:"nowrap"},V={id:"",text:`Stage 4 consisted of the lander's separation from the rocket.
