Every semester, random kids would make Discord servers for each individual class. They were incompetent at running them, moderating them, upkeeping them, AND there was just insanity trying to organize every class server for every semester. So I decided to make my own server with a twist. My server would be a hub which is fully autonomously administrated. The system would be a direct democracy where users within the server vote on important topics (such as adding/removing classes or kicking/banning malicious actors) and the autonomous backend robot is actually the entity with sovereignty to conduct the actions in the way the people vote. Voting integrity would be upheld by requiring phone verified accounts to join the server (you can make new accounts but they can't relink with the same phone number). When a vote were to be called, ALL participants of the server would be required to participate as a community endeavor (with all votes allowing yes/no/a third option basically stating \\"this vote doesn't concern me\\"). This *requirement* would be forced by removing access to all server channels for an individual until a vote participation has taken place, or after a vote's time had elapsed and the vote concluded, after which their access will be restored.`,fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},A={id:"",text:"2.
