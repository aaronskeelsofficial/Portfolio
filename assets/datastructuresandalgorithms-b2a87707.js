Not only will the knowledge REALISTICALLY come up in work at some point without doubt, but it will come up in technical interviews (warranted/effective or not). I've never had a scope of work which required optimizations the same way a corporate project might and as such, I've never taken the time to properly ingest this information under the understanding 'it would probably come intuitively if the time ever came'. Well, the time has come, and so I studied it. As presumed, it came very naturally and intuitively for about 95% of the material covered. I acknowledge what I learned didn't fully encompass every niche maximizing optimization to standard algorithms one can make, nor did it cover every data structure nor algorithm in existence, but I believe it was an important and very useful stepping stone for real life (actual work) and interviews (fake act untethered meaningfully from real world performance).",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},R={id:"",text:"2.

What does 'studying' entail? How do I prove that? Where do I go from here? As far as what my 'studies' entail, what I mean when I say that is I watched 45 hours worth of lecture, I took notes of paraphrased explanations on the side, and I *wrote* code (NO COPY/PASTE) relating to every single topic covered. A majority of that code was done off the top of my head without 'copying' the course so that I could mentally fully understand, though I did reference the course code after to see if I did anything unoptimally and fixed my approach if that was the case. I found this 'attempting independently and then referencing course material to correct any wrong direction' to be extremely effective in understanding on an intuitive and complete level. These studies led to immediately actionable influence over my workflow and work in general. I feel much better equipped and deliberately knowledgeable on a topic I previously only had general gists about. As far as proving my teachings, I suppose under a time constraint I may think poorly and reflect my learnings in bad light in interviews. In hopes of proving the content covered, my comprehension, and my ability to put it in action, I will be providing embeds of my work along with a link to the full source folder of all my work on Google Drive.
