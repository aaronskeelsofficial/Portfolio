Purpose",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},N={id:"",text:`For my fluid mechanics class I was assigned to develop a drag simulation utilizing the Source Panel Method in MatLab across a range of angles attack for a given airfoil. We were given the coordinates of the airfoil and some equations (which I didn't use because of their questionable results) and then simply told \\"go\\". I ended up deriving my own equations using linear algebra rather than the questionably compressed trig equations provided. The conclusion we were to come to is at which angle of attack is there zero lift. You'll notice in the last pic that there is no angle of attack which crosses the zero lift line. I believe this is erroneous and got different data using another equation I believed to be right, but the professor ASSURED me that this is the correct graph. I extended my aoa search beyond -7 degrees and the coefficient of lift skyrocketed WHICH DOESN'T HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE YOU DON'T TILT THE WING DOWN AND GET PROPELLED UPWARDS EXPONENTIALLY. I ultimately just went with it for the grade.`,fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true",whitespacephone:"nowrap"},E={id:"",text:"2.
