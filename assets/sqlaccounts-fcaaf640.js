Nothing worked the first time. Most things didn't work the fifth time. Documentation didn't help any so forum hopping was my only savior and even then, I had to improvise and patch together responses.

The demo page isn't the most appealing. That doesn't really matter to me as utilitarian demo page, but looking pretty never hurts.</p><br><p class=\\"blogtextlist\\">- Server-sided hashing. SHA256 hashing is currently being done on server-side. That is a nono. My initial thought process was \\"Oh I don't want to have people send the hash because that could be intercepted by a MITM\\" but realistically if they're going to get their hash stolen, they can equally get their password stolen. Whatever one client sends, regardless of hash or password, a MITM could just steal and send the same thing so it wouldn't make a difference and the cost of doing it my current wrong way is computation time.</p><br><p class=\\"blogtextlist\\">- Cleartext POST passwords. A fear I entirely looked over when deciding to send passwords rather than hashes is, currently users send cleartext passwords in POST requests. For https connections SSL security would make cleartext passwords negligibly problematic, but should I home host for testing or anything of that nature cleartext passwords are pretty bad.</p><br><p class=\\"blogtextlist\\">- Lacking session continuation. Another improvement is some sort of session handling implementation. Right now I have the demo generating a session stored server and client sided, but I don't do anything with it and have no form of session clearing server side. It simply lives on forever while the cookie client side expires. I can at least say the session UUID changes every login though and isn't constant. I've seen some implementations make static session UUID's across every login which feels CRAZY (looking at you Google with your constant session phishing attacks).</p>`,fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",textalign:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"},N={id:"",text:"Source/Demo",fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true",whitespacephone:"nowrap"},C={id:"",text:'Demo: <a href=\\"/projects/sqlaccounts/demo.html\\" style=\\"color: rgb(115,204,168)\\">Here</a><br>SQL Relay Server: <a href=\\"https://replit.com/@AaronSkeels1/portfolioservices\\" style=\\"color: rgb(115,204,168)\\">Here</a>',fontfamily:"",fontsize:"",fontweight:"",color:"",textalign:"",enablepc:"true",enablephone:"true"};function Q(){return n(a,{children:[e(d,{...v}),e(g,{...S}),e(s,{...I}),e(m,{...P}),e(b,{}),e(w,{...k}),e(u,{...z}),e(f,{}),e(t,{...B}),e(x,{...M}),e(t,{...T}),e(o,{...U}),e(t,{...D}),e(o,{...H}),e(t,{...j}),e(o,{...O}),e(t,{..._}),e(o,{...A}),e(t,{...L}),e(o,{...q}),e(t,{...N}),e(o,{...C}),e(y,{})]})}i.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(n(r.StrictMode,{children:[e(l,{}),e(c,{}),e(p,{}),e(Q,{}),e(h,{})]}));
